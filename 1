# Baxter-Robotic-Arm

## This project is ongoing.

Interfacing the Baxter arm with a kinect in gazebo. The URDF has been modified from the original to include the Kinect URDF.

This project relies on the [Baxter Simulator](http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Simulator_Installation) and the [Octomap](http://wiki.ros.org/octomap) library for ROS so it should be installed prior to merging this repository.
